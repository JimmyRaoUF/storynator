### Installation

Open the [demo][demo] and save the page.

### Managing cases and parts

Add, reorder or delete parts and cases by using the buttons shown with the option *Manage*. Click on a case to show more options.

Drag & drop to reorder things. Use the left handle for the parts (hiding the cases may help for that too).

Whithout the management mode, you can still edit texts and reorder cases.

### Text editing

The texts are directly editables.

Depending on your browser, you may apply **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ with the usual keyboard shortcuts.

### Images

You can apply an image by dropping a file onto it. The image files _**must**_ be on the ``story_files/`` directory and dropped from there.

### Display options

- *Cases* show / hide the cases to focus on the parts.
- *Texts* : show / hide parts and cases texts.
- *Big picture* : switch between two sizes of cases.

### Saving & sharing

Save the page. Like just ''Ctrl+S'' or ''Cmd+S''. Overwrite the old one if you want.

The project files (system files and storyboard images) are contained on a sibling directory (``story_files/`` by default). This directory name rely on the browser and OS implementations, so different browsers and OS may have different behaviors.

A project is self-contained. You can move it, copy it, send it trough mail, synchronize it trough Dropbox, BitSync or any other way. Just remember to include the project files in the sibling directory.
