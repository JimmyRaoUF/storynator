A simple html5 storyboard editor, with drag and drop and direct text editing.


#Menu

- Editing : show the buttons to add, delete and edit new parts or cases.
- Cases : show / hide cases to focus on the parts.
- Texts : show / hide parts and cases texts.
- Big picture : switch between two sizes of cases.

#Adding and deleting

Add new parts or cases with the buttons "ADD A NEW thing".
Delete parts by clicking on the top left cross.
You have access to the cases options by clicking on them in edit mode.
The cross icon delete the case, the arrow icon switch the case to "pano" mode (no width limit).

#Text editing

The texts are directly editables. You can use **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ with the usual keyboard shortcuts.
(you can edit the storyboard title, the parts titles and overviews, and the cases captions)

#Reordering things

Just drag & drop.

#Images

You can load an image on a case by dropping a file onto it.
-> The image files _**must**_ be on the ``story_files/`` directory and dropped from there.

#Saving

Save the file. Like ''Ctrl+S'' or ''Cmd+S''. And overwrite the old one.

#Sharing & collaborating

The project is self-contained. You can move it, copy it, send it trough mail, synchronize it trough Dropbox, BitSync or any other way. Juste remember to include the ``story_files/``.
