A simple html5 storyboard editor, with drag and drop and direct text editing.

#Managing cases and parts

By activating the management mode, you reveal the tools allowing to add, reorder or delete parts and cases. Click on the cases images to reveal their options : the cross delete the case and the arrow toggle the image width limit.

Drag & drop to reorder things. Drag directly the cases, and use the left handle for the parts (hiding the cases may help for that too).

(whithout the management mode, you can still edit texts and reorder cases)

#Text editing

The texts are directly editables. Depending on your browser, you may apply **bold**, *italic* and _underline_ with the usual keyboard shortcuts.

#Images

You can load an image on a case by dropping a file onto it. The image files _**must**_ be on the ``story_files/`` directory and dropped from there.

# Display options

- *Manage* : toggle the management mode.
- *Cases* show / hide the cases to focus on the parts.
- *Texts* : show / hide parts and cases texts.
- *Big picture* : switch between two sizes of cases.

#Saving & sharing

Save the page. Like just ''Ctrl+S'' or ''Cmd+S''. And overwrite the old one.

The project files (system files and storyboard images) are contained on a sibling directory (``story_files/`` by default). This directory name rely on the browser and OS implementations. Different browsers and OS may have different behaviors.

A project is self-contained. You can move it, copy it, send it trough mail, synchronize it trough Dropbox, BitSync or any other way. Just remember to include the project files in the sibling directory.
